Re: Dispute of Inaccurate Information - ${discrepancy.accountName}${discrepancy.accountNumber ? ` - Account #${discrepancy.accountNumber}` : ''}

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing in accordance with my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. ยง 1681 et seq., to dispute inaccurate information appearing on my credit report.

After reviewing my credit report from ${discrepancy.bureau}, I have identified the following item that is inaccurate and requires investigation and correction:

Account Name: ${discrepancy.accountName}
${discrepancy.accountNumber ? `Account Number: ${discrepancy.accountNumber}` : ''}
Reason for Dispute: ${discrepancy.reason}

This information is inaccurate because: ${disputeExplanation}

${citationsText}you are required to conduct a reasonable investigation into this matter and remove or correct any information that cannot be verified. Additionally, Section 623 of the FCRA places responsibilities on furnishers of information to provide accurate data to consumer reporting agencies.

I request that you:
1. Conduct a thorough investigation of this disputed information
2. Forward all relevant information to the furnisher of this information
3. Provide me with copies of any documentation used to verify this debt
4. Remove the disputed item if it cannot be properly verified
5. Send me an updated copy of my credit report showing the results of your investigation

Please complete your investigation within the 30-day timeframe (or 45 days if based on information I provide) as required by the FCRA. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact me at the address listed above.

Sincerely,

${userInfo.name}
