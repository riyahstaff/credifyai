RE: Dispute of Duplicate Student Loan Reporting on Credit Report

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to dispute duplicate student loan information on my credit report that I believe to be inaccurate. After reviewing my credit report dated [REPORT_DATE], I have identified the following discrepancies:

Student Loan Information:
Original Loan Provider: [ORIGINAL_CREDITOR]
Current Loan Provider: [CREDITOR_NAME]
Account Number: [ACCOUNT_NUMBER]
Loan Amount: [BALANCE]

Issue: This student loan appears to be reported multiple times on my credit report with identical loan amounts but under different loan servicers. This is a duplicate reporting violation, as the loan has been transferred/sold to another servicer but is being reported as separate accounts.

This violates 15 USC 1681s-2(a)(1) which requires furnishers to provide accurate information to credit reporting agencies, and 20 USC 1087 which governs student loan servicing.

Please investigate this matter and remove the duplicate reporting from my credit report. If you cannot verify which entry is the correct current one within the 30-day period specified by law, all duplicate entries must be removed.

Please send me written confirmation of your findings and a corrected copy of my credit report.
