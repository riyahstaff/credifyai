RE: Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Information - Collection Account Disputes
Credit Report Number: {CREDIT_REPORT_NUMBER}
SSN: {CONSUMER_SSN_LAST4}
DOB: {CONSUMER_DOB}

To whom it may concern:

I am formally asking you to investigate your data for me and ensure that it is accurate and compliant. I have the right to have accurate information on my credit report, and I am demanding that you take action to correct any inaccuracies immediately. I have identified several collection accounts on my credit report that contain inaccurate information and/or fail to comply with required reporting standards.

Below are the collection accounts I am disputing:

{COLLECTION_ACCOUNTS_LIST}

The information above was never proven to meet compliance reporting standards. The information was never verified to be accurate or complete. I demand that this information be deleted immediately!

I challenge the accuracy of these accounts on my credit report. You are deficient in your ability to report accurately if you cannot prove compliance with federal and state regulations! I am looking for evidence that these accounts are compliant. Show me how exactly they meet all the requirements of current regulation.

You are in serious trouble if you can't provide proof that these accounts have been compliant with all current regulations! I need evidence to back up your claims. The federal and state regulations are a necessary component in ensuring that your company is run responsibly. I can't imagine how we would operate if they were not obeyed! So, let's take this opportunity for you to show me proof of your adherence to applicable compliance standards for these particular accounts.

When I scrutinized these accounts, I found that they appear to be inaccurate or inconsistent with the established reporting standards of CDIA. I would like you to review this report again and PROVE that everything is true, accurate (i.e., dates), compliant with all requirements & comply immediately if unable!

Compliance with regulatory requirements is essential for accurate credit reporting! Prove to me that your information for these accounts has been fully vetted and meets all the standards of federal law, including but not limited to Metro 2 standards. I need you to show proof or explain how these accounts are compliant.

These discrepancies are alarming and I'm confident you'll resolve them quickly. Please review the accounts with a fine tooth comb, as it appears that something isn't quite right here! The data appears inaccurate or inconsistent with established reporting standards of the CDIA.

I demand that any wrong, incomplete, or unsupported material be deleted from the content that was never certified to be in conformity with reporting standards. The preceding data was never proven to be exact, complete, up to date, or validated, and I require any documentation confirming compliance with reporting obligations and any consumer legislation.

Please investigate these matters and remove or correct the disputed items. According to the FCRA, you must complete your investigation within 30 days of receiving this dispute.

I expect a prompt response to this matter. Please send your written response to my address listed above.

Sincerely,

{CONSUMER_FULL_NAME}`;
