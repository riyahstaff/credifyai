Re: My certified letter in notice of an official consumer declaration of complaint for your thus far NOT proven true, NOT proven correct, NOT proven complete, NOT proven timely, or NOT proven compliant mis-information related to UNAUTHORIZED CREDIT INQUIRIES. I am enacting my consumer and or civil rights to compel you here and now to absolutely and permanently remove any and all aspects of untrue, inaccurate, not complete, not timely, not proven mine, not proven my responsibility, and or not proven adequately and entirely compliant allegations of credit information.

To Whom It May Concern:

I received a copy of my credit report and found the following inquiry item(s) to be errors, or are deficient of proof of not being untrue, incorrect, incomplete, untimely, not mine, not my responsibility, or else wise not compliant, to include to metro 2 reporting standards.

Here as follows are items in potential error requiring immediate annulment of the retainment and or reporting:

Summary of Inquiries being challenged in list form:
[COMPANY NAME] - [DATE OF INQUIRY]

These items must have been misplaced or inaccurate. I'm disputing these claims and demanding that any information about inquiries that I did not authorize be removed immediately. The allegations that these inquiries were authorized are unsubstantiated. To date, I have not received any physical proof to back up these allegations.

Your report contains several deviations from mandatory reporting standards. As such, the data in your documents cannot be accurate and complete! I hereby challenge you to provide proof that it is right for you to make these allegations about me.

The federal and my state laws require full compliance to any and all standards of exacting and perfect reporting in its entirety, and should I be compelled to direct a consumer request for a lawful potential resolution via civil or criminal courts, undoubtedly the court and its ruling magistrate would requisite irrefutable evidence to every single and each any and all of the aspects of mandated reporting of which you are obligated, to include full proof in testimonial certificate to your precise inquiries reporting.

LEGAL BASIS FOR MY DISPUTE:

Per 15 U.S.C § 1681e: "Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates."

Also per 12 CFR Part 1022 (Regulation V) requires furnishers to:
A - Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity.
B - Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate.
C - Conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes.

It is crucial to remember that any mistakes in reporting can make the information less accurate. This has significant implications for both federally regulated reports and Metro 2 compliance standards, as CRRG states: "Any deviations from these standards jeopardize data integrity."

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 (a)(1)(A), you are required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report. Otherwise, anyone paying for your reporting services could fax, mail or email in even a potentially fraudulent account.

According to the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act § 611(a) [15 USC 1681i(a)], these disputed items must be reinvestigated or deleted from my credit record within 30 days. During the investigation period, these items must be removed from my credit report as the mere reporting of items prior to debt validation constitutes collection activity.

REQUEST FOR ACTION:

1. Conduct a thorough investigation of these disputed inquiries.
2. Verify with each company that I provided authorization for these inquiries.
3. Provide me with copies of any documentation bearing my signature authorizing these credit pulls.
4. Remove these unauthorized inquiries from my credit report immediately.
5. Send me written confirmation when these items have been removed.
6. Provide me with the names, addresses and telephone numbers of individuals you contacted during your investigation.

Please notify me that the above items have been deleted pursuant to § 611 (a)(6) [15 USC § 1681j (a) (6)]. I am also requesting an updated copy of my credit report, which should be sent to the address listed below. According to the provisions of § 612 [15 USC § 1681j], there should be no charge for this report.

The CRSA enacted CDIA Metro 2 compliant reporting format REQUIRES the precise and exact fully complete 426-character P-Segment or Trailing Segment that is to include the minimally five portioned PERSONAL IDENTIFIERS to which databasing of alleged tradeline information occurs. Per CRSA, auto-populating ANY data field input entry and or application of Slash Entries (such as 11111 or 00000, etc) into the Metro 2 system is automatic call for deletion due to any and all repeating entry as NULL and VOID.

THANK YOU IN ADVANCE for your WILLFUL rectifying of the notated MIS-INFORMATION above indicated,
My First and My Last name is: [YOUR NAME]
My Street NUMBER and My Street NAME is:
[YOUR ADDRESS]
My City and My State is:
[CITY], [STATE] [ZIP]

Enclosures:
- Proof of identification

Please send your written response to my address of [YOUR ADDRESS], [CITY], [STATE] [ZIP].

I am aware that you have been sending out form letters in response to many of the disputes and challenges that consumers have submitted, regardless of the specific information that they have provided. This is illegal, as each dispute and challenge must be addressed individually and on its own merits.

If you do not process my letter in a timely manner, I will consider it to be an intentional disregard of my rights as a consumer under 15 U.S. Code § 1681i and will take appropriate legal action.`;
