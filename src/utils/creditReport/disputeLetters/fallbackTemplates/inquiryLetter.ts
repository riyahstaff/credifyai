RE: DISPUTE OF UNAUTHORIZED CREDIT INQUIRIES
REFERENCE: INQUIRY DELETION REQUEST

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing in accordance with my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), specifically Sections 604 and 611, to dispute unauthorized inquiries appearing on my credit report.

After reviewing my credit report, I discovered the following inquiries I did not authorize:

DISPUTED ITEM(S):
- Company Name: [COMPANY NAME]
- Inquiry Date: [DATE OF INQUIRY]

I did not authorize this company to pull my credit report or make any inquiry into my credit file. This constitutes a serious breach of my privacy rights and a violation of FCRA Section 604, which only permits inquiries with proper authorization or a permissible purpose.

These inquiries must have been misplaced or inaccurate. I'm disputing these claims and demanding that this information be removed from my credit report. The allegations that this inquiry is authorized are unsubstantiated. To date, I have not received any physical proof to back up these allegations.

Your report contains several deviations from mandatory reporting standards. As such, the data in your documents cannot be accurate and complete! I hereby challenge you to provide proof that these inquiries were authorized by me.

LEGAL BASIS FOR MY DISPUTE:

Per 15 U.S.C ยง 1681e: "Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates."

Also per 12 CFR Part 1022 (Regulation V) requires furnishers to:
A - Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity.
B - Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate.
C - Conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes.

It is crucial to remember that any mistakes in reporting can make the information less accurate. This has significant implications for both federally regulated reports and Metro 2 compliance standards, as CRRG states: "Any deviations from these standards jeopardize data integrity."

REQUEST FOR ACTION:

1. Please conduct a thorough investigation of these disputed inquiries.
2. Verify with the company that I provided authorization for these inquiries.
3. Provide me with copies of any documentation bearing my signature authorizing these credit pulls.
4. Remove these unauthorized inquiries from my credit report immediately.
5. Send me written confirmation when these items have been removed.

According to the FCRA Section 611, you have 30 days to complete this investigation. If you cannot verify these inquiries were authorized, they must be removed from my credit file.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME]

Enclosures:
- Copy of Driver's License
- Copy of Social Security Card

Please send your written response to my address of [YOUR ADDRESS], [CITY, STATE ZIP].

I am aware that you have been sending out form letters in response to many of the disputes and challenges that consumers have submitted, regardless of the specific information that they have provided. This is illegal, as each dispute and challenge must be addressed individually and on its own merits.

If you do not process my letter in a timely manner, I will consider it to be an intentional disregard of my rights as a consumer under 15 U.S. Code ยง 1681i and will take appropriate legal action.`;
